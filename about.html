        <p>How would I describe myself?</p>
        </div>
        <p> I would most likely describe myself as someone incredibly proactive, organized but also slightly stuborn. However I do believe those are the atributes that allow me to persevere through my work until I'm completely satisfied with it every time.</p>
        <br>
        <div class="perg">
        <p>What drew me into being an artist?</p>
        </div>
        <p>Ever since I was a child, I've always been surrounded by art due to my mom's influence: she has always enjoyed painting, embroidering, and experimenting with several materials and techniques, while also doing commisions and having a full time job.</p>
        <p>However it was hard for me to actually decide to persue art due to the bad stigma that artists have in the work industry. I am just incredibly proud of myself for actually going after what I wanted.</p>
        <br>
        <div class="perg">
        <p>Where am I from and how does that affect my work?</p>
        </div>
        <p>I was born and raised in Portugal but I don’t believe that had much of an influence regarding my creations, specially since I seek inspiration from both national and international artists.</p>
        <br>
        <div class="perg">
        <p>How has my education helped in developing my art?</p>
        </div>
        <p>My education has been a huge influence in my improvement as an artist, ever since 2019 (when I was first introduced to the arts high school IAI) I’ve come a long way and got to really experiment with different mediums and subjects, gaining a new point of view over matters that seemed otherwise irrelevant to the art world. Besides that, it also allowed me to make friends who share the same passion as I do.</p>
        <br>
        <div class="perg">
        <p>What projects did I most enjoy being a part of?</p>
        </div>
        <p>In 11th grade I got to focus a lot more in projects revolving around video (specially Short Films), which were my favorite projects to work on, especially participating in Bgreen, a contest whose goal was to make a 45 second film regarding that year’s theme, “ Earthability”.</p>
        <br>
        <div class="perg">
        <p>Favorite mediums/ types of art?</p>
        </div>
        <p>Out of all the materials and techniques I’ve experimented with, my favorite has to be either grafite or oil pastels. The first one takes me a lot more time to work with but never fails to give me an incredibly realistic result that always fascinates me; the second allows me to be a lot more creative and so it’s more entertaining to use. However I’m always open to experiment with new things.</p>
        <br>
        <div class="perg">
        <p>What motivates me to create?</p>
        </div>
        <p>Being able to go through my old art work and immediately notice my progress and how much I’ve improved is for sure a big part of my source of motivation. Besides the way my friends always hype me up while I draw/ work makes me want to do more and succeed for them and also for me, so that I’m able to look back to this moment and know for sure that I did the best I could at all times.</p>
